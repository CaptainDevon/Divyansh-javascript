# ðŸ“‹ Personal Details Form â€“ Full Stack App

This is a full stack web application where users can enter their personal details, including **first name**, **last name**, **gender**, and **age**. Upon submitting the form, the data is sent to a Node.js + Express backend, which processes the input and returns a personalized message. The frontend dynamically displays this message on the page with styled text, providing an interactive and responsive user experience.
