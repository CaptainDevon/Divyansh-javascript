# JavaScript Learning & Projects Workspace

This workspace contains a comprehensive collection of JavaScript learning resources, code samples, and project implementations. It is organized into several directories, each focusing on different aspects of JavaScript, from core fundamentals to advanced backend and frontend projects.

---

## Directory Overview & Project Descriptions

### 1. `javascript fundamentals/`
A collection of scripts and modules covering the basics and core concepts of JavaScript, including:
- Arrays, functions, arrow functions, and loops
- Operators (assignment, comparison, conditional)
- Control flow (if-else, switch, ternary)
- Error handling and asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Working with JSON, file I/O, and date formatting
- Practical examples like badge assignment, logging, and user input

### 2. `JavaScript Interacting with HTML CSS/`
Hands-on projects demonstrating how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS to build dynamic web applications. Example projects include:

- **Age Calculator App**  
  A web application where users can input their date of birth, and the app calculates and displays their current age. This project demonstrates handling user input, date manipulation, and updating the DOM dynamically.

- **To Do List**  
  A simple to-do list application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and remove tasks. It showcases DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management in JavaScript.

- **Background Colour Changer**  
  An interactive tool that lets users change the background color of the webpage by clicking a button or selecting a color. This project highlights working with CSS styles via JavaScript.

- **Letter Counter**  
  A utility that counts the number of letters in a user-provided text input. It demonstrates real-time input handling and updating the UI based on user actions.

- **Bringing Backend Content to Frontend**  
  Demonstrates fetching data from a backend API and displaying it on the frontend. This project covers making HTTP requests using JavaScript and updating the DOM with dynamic content.

### 3. `learning Node js/`
Explores Node.js concepts and features, such as:
- Creating HTTP servers to serve content or APIs
- Using modules and classes to structure code
- Working with timers (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`) for scheduling tasks
- Process management and handling standard input/output
- Using third-party libraries like Lodash for utility functions

### 4. `React Native Framework/`
A placeholder for learning and experimenting with React Native for building cross-platform mobile applications. (No major projects yet, but intended for future mobile app development.)

### 5. `REST API Using Node JS/`
A series of backend and full-stack implementations using Node.js and Express, demonstrating REST API development with different data storage approaches:

- **Implementation 1: REST API with Array**  
  A basic REST API where data is stored in an in-memory JavaScript array. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing resources. This implementation is ideal for understanding REST principles without involving databases.

- **Implementation 2: REST API with MongoDB**  
  An enhanced REST API that uses MongoDB as the data store. It demonstrates connecting Node.js to a database, performing CRUD operations, and handling asynchronous database queries.

- **Implementation 3: REST API with React + Vite Frontend**  
  A full-stack project combining a Node.js REST API backend with a modern React frontend built using Vite. The frontend interacts with the backend to display and manage data, showcasing full-stack development and API consumption.

- **Implementation 4: REST API with MongoDB Atlas**  
  Similar to Implementation 2, but uses MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted database service. This project demonstrates connecting to cloud databases and deploying scalable backend services.

- **Implementation 5: E-Billing System (REST API with JSON File Storage)**  
  This project is a RESTful API for an E-Billing System, where all billing data is stored in a JSON file on disk. The system allows users to create, read, update, and delete billing records through HTTP endpoints. It is designed to simulate a simple electronic billing platform suitable for small businesses or as a learning tool for file-based persistence in Node.js.

  **Key Features:**
  - **Create Bill:** Add new billing records with customer details, items, amounts, and dates.
  - **Read Bills:** Retrieve all bills or a specific bill by ID.
  - **Update Bill:** Modify existing billing records.
  - **Delete Bill:** Remove a bill from the system.
  - **Persistent Storage:** All data is saved in a JSON file, ensuring data is retained between server restarts.
  - **Error Handling:** Handles invalid requests and file I/O errors gracefully.

  **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Understanding REST API design and CRUD operations.
  - Working with file system modules in Node.js for reading and writing JSON data.
  - Implementing data validation and error handling.
  - Structuring a backend project for real-world use cases.

  **Usage:**
  - Start the server with Node.js.
  - Use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints for managing bills.
  - The project can be extended with authentication, reporting, or integration with a frontend.

  This E-Billing System demonstrates practical backend development skills and provides a foundation for more advanced billing or invoicing applications.

Each implementation includes its own `README.md` with specific setup and usage instructions.

## How to Use This Workspace

- Browse the directories to explore code samples and projects.
- Each project or implementation is self-contained and can be run independently.
- For backend projects, ensure you have Node.js and any required dependencies installed.
- For frontend projects, follow the instructions in their respective `README.md` files.
